# ## Variable Names and Descriptions

# - `bdir`: Defines the backup directory path where compressed log files will be stored.
# - `ts`: Stores the timestamp in the format "YYYYMMDDHHMMSS" for creating unique backup file names.
# - `lf`: Represents the current log file being processed in various parts of the script.
# - `cf`: Stores the path of the compressed backup file for the current log file.
# - `orig_size`: Holds the size in bytes of the original log file before compression.
# - `comp_size`: Stores the size in bytes of the compressed backup file.
# - `logs`: An array containing the paths of the log files to be backed up.

# These variables are used to manage the backup, compression, and comparison of log files in the script.
